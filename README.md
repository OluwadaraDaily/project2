# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

If you visit the site for the first time you get to input your display name. 
After that, you get to the channels page where you get to add channels as you like. 

If it is not your first time, then, you would be redirected to the channels page directly.

If you select one channel, you get to see a chat interface where you can send messages and recieve messages in real time. 

The personal touch I added was that users can choose to change their username or display name.
